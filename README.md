## Hi there 👋

I’m Mateusz Puchacz, currently working as a Supply Manager at the Polish headquarters of a French hypermarket chain.

In practice, my role is fully analytical, 100% of my work is based on data supporting around 65 hypermarkets nationwide.

###  What I do

- Extract, clean and transform data (Power Query)
- Build reporting structures and dashboards
- Analyze sales performance, margins and product rotation
- Optimize inventory levels to reduce overstock and stockouts
- Evaluate promotion performance and business impact
- Maintain weekly reporting used for real time decision making

I work closely with the French headquarters, analyzing cross border supply performance and ensuring data consistency across markets.

### My focus

I design reporting tools that help commercial teams monitor KPIs, control profitability and improve operational efficiency.  
I continuously standardize and automate reporting processes to reduce manual work and increase analytical clarity.

### Currently developing

I’m expanding my technical skill set in:

- SQL
- Power BI
- Data modeling
- DAX

My goal is to fully transition into a Data Analyst role, combining strong business understanding with technical data expertise.
